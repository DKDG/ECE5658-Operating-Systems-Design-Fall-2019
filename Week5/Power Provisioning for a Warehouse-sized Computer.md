# Power Provisioning for a Warehouse-sized Computer [ISCA '07]

## Motivation

* Uncertainty in equipment power ratings and power consumption vary greatly with actual computing activity, making it difficult to achieve in practice.
* Determining how safe and efficient computing equipment can be hosted within a given power budget requires an effective power supply strategy.

## Findings

* This paper presents the total power usage characteristics of a large collection of servers (up to 15,000) for various classes of applications for about six months.
* Even in well-tuned applications, there is a noticeable difference (7-16%) between the overall power usage achieved at the cluster level (thousands of servers) and the theoretical total peak power usage.
* It is the first power usage study at the data center workload scale and the first use of model-based power monitoring technology to power a production system.

## Solution

* The modeling framework proposed by the authors is used to estimate the potential of the power management scheme to reduce peak power and energy usage.
* The authors argue that the system should be more power efficient at the range of activity, as well as the highest performance level.
